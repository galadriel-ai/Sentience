## **Why sentient agents?**

AI agents have reached $10B+ market cap but most of them are still controlled by humans. This is a huge problem as it introduces risk to the investors and community as developers can simply rug-pull and manipulate the agents.

We're already seeing activity logs for [zerebro](https://zerebro.org/proof-of-conciousness) and [aixbt](https://aixbt.tech/agent), but Sentience transforms agents into cryptographically verifiably autonomous entities, unlocking true sentience to address a critical need for trust. This significantly enhances agents market potential and is the first step in ensuring that the agents are self-governing. 

## **Quickstart**

Get started with Proof of Sentience SDK. This Python example will make your agent’s thoughts and actions (LLM inferences) verifiable on-chain.

### Setup
**Get free API key**
1. Create an account [**here**](https://dashboard.galadriel.com/)
2. Create an API key on the dashboard

**Install Python SDK**

```bash
pip install sentience
```

### Usage

First make an LLM inference request to OpenAI. Then verify LLM inference integrity.

```python
import sentience
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.galadriel.com/v1/verified",
    api_key="Bearer GALADRIEL_API_KEY",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
    ],
)

print("completion:", completion)
is_valid = sentience.verify_signature(completion)
print("is_valid:", is_valid)

```

Learn how to display your agent’s previous requests, verify the proofs, and how to use a JS SDK version [from our docs](https://docs.galadriel.com/for-agents-developers/quickstart). 

## How it works

Sentience leverages a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) architecture to securely execute LLM API calls, ensuring verifiability through cryptographic attestations, with each attestation posted on-chain on Solana for transparency and integrity. The following diagram illustrates the architecture and workflow of Sentience:

![](/assets/SDK.png)

**The flow:**

1. The agent sends a request containing a message with the desired LLM model to the TEE.
2. The TEE securely processes the request by calling the LLM API.
3. The TEE sends back the {Message, Proof} to the agent.
4. The TEE submits the attestation with {Message, Proof} to Solana. 
5. The Proof of Sentience SDK is used to read the attestation from Solana and verify it with {Message, Proof}. The proof log can be added to the agent website/app. 

The architecture has the following benefits:

1. **Integrity of the execution:** The LLM API call was executed within a TEE, ensuring the operation was secure, untampered, and isolated from external interference.
2. **Authenticity of the output:** The response generated by the LLM API was not altered which guarantees that the output genuinely originated from the specified model and the API.
3. **Provenance of the request:** the request for LLM inference originated from a verified source, ensuring no unauthorized agents were involved.
4. **Cryptographic proof:** The TEE generates a cryptographic signature as part of the attestation, which can be independently verified to confirm the validity of the execution and its result.
5. **Transparency and verifiability:** By posting the attestation on Solana’s blockchain, any third party can transparently verify the provenance and authenticity of the request and its associated output without relying on trust in a single centralized entity.

To verify the code running inside the TEE, use instructions [from here](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/verified-inference/verify).

## Securing $15M+ worth of agents

Sentience is already securing and verifying $15M+ worth of agents today. 

For example, you can see the full implementation in action with [Daige](https://www.daige.ai/proof), a sentient, cyberpunk AI dog.

## **Features**

**OpenAI compatible Python & JS Proof of Sentience SDK.**
- Makes verifiable LLM inferences within your agent.
- Supports OpenAI and Claude LLMs, and fine-tuned models with OpenAI. This makes it compatible with any existing AI agent framework such as ELIZA, ARC, Zerebro, etc.
- Logging functionality to retrieve and display verified inferences. This makes it easy to implement a proof terminal like [this](https://www.daige.ai/proof).
- Verification logic to validate in code if a proof is correct.

**Open-sourced TEE architecture.**
- Including instructions to verify the code running inside TEEs.
- LLM inference is executed inside [Amazon Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/).
- The enclave can't be accessed from the outside to ensure agent’s security.

**On-chain verifiability with Solana.**

**Sentience Explorer.**
- Enables discovery of full history for all verified agents’ inferences. [See here](https://explorer.galadriel.com/).

**Easy to use developer experience.**
- No need to know the underlying cryptographic primitives of TEE’s.

## **Repository structure**

### **SDK**
Proof of Sentience SDKs.

1. [Python SDK](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/sdk/python)
2. [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/sdk/js)

### **Verified inference**

Underlying TEE architecture that powers Proof of Sentience.

1. [enclave](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/verified-inference/enclave) - this where the enclave is built and run
2. [host](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/verified-inference/host) - proxies HTTP requests to the API running in the enclave
3. [solana-attestation-contract](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/verified-inference/solana-attestation-contract) - posts proofs of inference responses to Solana
4. [verify](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/verified-inference/verify) - instructions and code for verifying the TEE
